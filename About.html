                        <p>The Cat Powerlifting Federation&trade; was established in 1950 by Smilin Jasper who believed that safety was most important in the sport of powerlifting. We are the world's largest powerlifting federation with 93 member federations
                            internationally. We conduct both drug tested and non-drug tested competetions for athletes to compete. Athletes can join our meets to show their feats of strength in the Bench Press, Sqaut and the Deadlift. Athletes are categorized
                            by age, sex and bodyweight. The most weight lifted by each athlete in each of the three lifts judged by our proficient judging team will be added to the athlete's total. The athlete with the most total in a given category is
                            declared the winner. In cases where two athletes have the same total, the one with the lightest bodyweight is declared the winner.

                        <p>We are on a mission to make all tested events fair by having rigourous passing standards. So Performance Enhancing Drug (PED) use of any kind will not be condoned.</p>

                            <h3>Couple of things worth mentioning</h3>

                            <li>Any kind of drug prescribed by a doctor that does not comply with our rules will get you banned.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>If you have ADHD and are prescribed potentially performance enhancing drugs, even though we will not question you whether you really have ADHD or not, you must get a medical certificate with all the details of your medication
                                and a confirmation. </li>
